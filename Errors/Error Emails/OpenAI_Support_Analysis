OpenAI Support Analysis

Based on the provided documents and excerpts, it appears that you have encountered multiple instances where the support from OpenAI has been unsatisfactory. Many of the replies from OpenAI support seem to be automated responses directing you to the help center or the Messenger for immediate assistance. This lack of personalized attention can be frustrating, especially when the issues raised are specific and require tailored solutions.

The responses from support often lack personalization and do not seem to address the specific issues you raised, such as disappearing GPTs or dynamic usage limitations. For instance, when you reported that one of your custom GPTs was deleted, the response did not provide a satisfactory resolution or explanation. Instead, it merely directed you to general support resources. This kind of response can feel dismissive and unhelpful, leaving your issues unresolved.

Additionally, follow-up responses are often repetitive, restating the initial advice to visit the help center without providing further actionable solutions. This repetition without progress can add to the frustration, as it feels like your concerns are not being adequately addressed. The delayed and repetitive replies can hinder your ability to quickly resolve pressing issues, impacting your productivity and experience with the platform.

There were also issues related to custom GPTs, such as deletions or errors, which were not adequately addressed by support. When custom-built GPTs that you created disappear or malfunction, it significantly disrupts your workflow. The lack of adequate support in resolving these issues only exacerbates the problem, making it difficult to rely on the platform for your projects.

To improve your experience with support, consider providing as many specific details as possible when reporting an issue, including screenshots, error messages, and steps to reproduce the problem. If initial support responses are not helpful, try escalating the issue by asking to speak with a higher level of support or a supervisor. Utilize different support channels, such as the help center, forums, and direct email, to increase the chances of getting a timely and useful response. Engaging with the OpenAI community forums can also be beneficial, as other users may have encountered similar issues and can provide insights or workarounds.

Maintain a detailed log of all interactions with support, including dates, responses received, and any follow-up actions taken. This documentation can be useful if you need to reference past communications or escalate issues. Consolidating related issues into a single, comprehensive report can help the support team understand the broader context and provide more effective solutions.
