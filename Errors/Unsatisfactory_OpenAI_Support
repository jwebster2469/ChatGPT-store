Sourceduty's uploaded error emails provide a detailed account of the frustrations with OpenAI support, highlighting several recurring issues. These emails reveal a pattern of automated and generic responses, persistent problems with custom GPTs, dynamic usage limitations, delayed and repetitive replies, and overall dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of support.

One major issue highlighted in the emails is the prevalence of automated and generic responses from OpenAI support. Users frequently receive replies that simply direct them to visit the help center or use the Messenger for assistance, without addressing their specific problems. This approach leaves users feeling that their unique issues are not being acknowledged or resolved adequately​​​​​​.

Another significant concern is the persistent issues with custom GPTs. Users report various problems, such as custom GPTs being deleted or malfunctioning. Despite reaching out to support, these issues are not adequately resolved. For instance, one email mentions a custom GPT disappearing from the user's account and the inability to export data, which significantly disrupts their workflow​​.

Dynamic usage limitations imposed by ChatGPT also emerge as a common complaint. Users express frustration with these limitations, which affect their ability to work efficiently. The support responses to these complaints are often unsatisfactory, failing to provide clear explanations or solutions to the dynamic restrictions being imposed​​.

Delays in receiving helpful responses and repetitive replies further exacerbate users' frustrations. Many users experience significant delays in getting their issues addressed, and when responses do come, they often repeat the initial advice without offering any new or actionable solutions. This repetitive communication leaves users feeling stuck and unsupported​​​​.

Overall, the emails convey a general frustration with the lack of effective and personalized support from OpenAI. Users' detailed issues are met with generic responses that do not help resolve their problems, leading to dissatisfaction and a sense of being ignored. This pattern of inadequate support undermines users' trust and confidence in the platform's ability to address their concerns effectively​
