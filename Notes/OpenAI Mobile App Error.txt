OpenAI - Mobile App Login Error

On Nov 28, 2023 at 7:22 PM I sent the first email to OpenAI regarding the mobile app login error. I included two screenshots of error notifications captured on my Android device. I wasn't able to login to the mobile app when I first signed up for ChatGPT on Thu, Oct 5, 2023.
