<details><summary>OpenAI, AGI and ASI</summary>
<br>

OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT, focuses heavily on pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, with a long-term goal of steering towards AGI in a safe and beneficial manner. Achieving AGI involves overcoming several major challenges. One such challenge is the ability of AGI to generalize knowledge across different contexts without extensive retraining. This requires a shift from the pattern recognition capabilities of current AI systems to a more profound capability for abstract thinking and complex problem-solving.

While OpenAI is at the forefront of this research, the transition from AI to AGI also poses substantial ethical and safety considerations. OpenAI emphasizes the importance of developing AGI in a way that aligns with human values and societal needs, aiming to mitigate risks associated with powerful AI technologies. The path towards AGI is fraught with both technical challenges and profound implications, making it a pivotal focus of AI research where organizations like OpenAI play a crucial role. The timeline for achieving AGI remains uncertain, dependent on breakthroughs across various domains of AI research.

ChatGPT is an example of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a broad range of tasks, much like a human. However, it's not quite at the level of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which would surpass the cognitive performance of humans in practically all domains, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. The evolution of AI from its current state to ASI involves significant advancements and breakthroughs in multiple areas of AI research and development, including understanding of human intelligence, improvements in hardware and software, and breakthroughs in learning algorithms and data processing.

<details><summary>Why can't ChatGPT export custom GPT statistics?</summary>
<br>

As of now, ChatGPT cannot export custom GPT statistics directly due to a combination of technical limitations and design choices. Here are some reasons why:

1. Data Privacy and Security: Exporting detailed statistics might raise privacy and security concerns, especially if the data contains sensitive information. Ensuring that data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy laws can be complex.

2. Technical Infrastructure: The infrastructure needed to support exporting detailed statistics securely and reliably can be complex. This includes handling data storage, processing, and ensuring that the exported data is accurate and up-to-date.

3. API and Feature Limitations: The current APIs and features provided by the platform may not support direct export functionality. Implementing such a feature would require significant changes to the existing system.

4. User Demand and Prioritization: Features are often prioritized based on user demand and strategic goals. If exporting custom GPT statistics is not a high-priority feature based on user feedback and the platform's development roadmap, it may not be implemented yet.

5. Data Formatting and Standardization: Exporting statistics in a format that is useful and standardized can be challenging. Different users might require different formats, and ensuring compatibility with various tools and systems adds another layer of complexity.

While these are some of the possible reasons, it's also worth noting that platforms like ChatGPT are continuously evolving, and features are regularly updated and added based on user feedback and technological advancements. If exporting statistics is a critical feature for many users, it's possible that it could be added in the future.

<details><summary>Why were the custom GPT upload dates removed?</summary>
<br>

The feature to display upload dates for custom GPTs was removed due to user feedback and the decision to simplify the interface. Many users found the upload dates less relevant to their selection process, prioritizing functionality and reviews over chronological order. This change aimed to enhance user experience by focusing on more pertinent information for choosing and utilizing custom GPTs.

<details><summary>Unsatisfactory OpenAI Support</summary>
<br>

Sourceduty's uploaded error emails provide a detailed account of the frustrations with OpenAI support, highlighting several recurring issues. These emails reveal a pattern of automated and generic responses, persistent problems with custom GPTs, dynamic usage limitations, delayed and repetitive replies, and overall dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of support.

One major issue highlighted in the emails is the prevalence of automated and generic responses from OpenAI support. Users frequently receive replies that simply direct them to visit the help center or use the Messenger for assistance, without addressing their specific problems. This approach leaves users feeling that their unique issues are not being acknowledged or resolved adequately​​​​​​.

Another significant concern is the persistent issues with custom GPTs. Users report various problems, such as custom GPTs being deleted or malfunctioning. Despite reaching out to support, these issues are not adequately resolved. For instance, one email mentions a custom GPT disappearing from the user's account and the inability to export data, which significantly disrupts their workflow​​.

Dynamic usage limitations imposed by ChatGPT also emerge as a common complaint. Users express frustration with these limitations, which affect their ability to work efficiently. The support responses to these complaints are often unsatisfactory, failing to provide clear explanations or solutions to the dynamic restrictions being imposed​​.

Delays in receiving helpful responses and repetitive replies further exacerbate users' frustrations. Many users experience significant delays in getting their issues addressed, and when responses do come, they often repeat the initial advice without offering any new or actionable solutions. This repetitive communication leaves users feeling stuck and unsupported​​​​.

Overall, the emails convey a general frustration with the lack of effective and personalized support from OpenAI. Users' detailed issues are met with generic responses that do not help resolve their problems, leading to dissatisfaction and a sense of being ignored. This pattern of inadequate support undermines users' trust and confidence in the platform's ability to address their concerns effectively​
