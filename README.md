Sourceduty won't use ChatGPT without also using GitHub. This repository will be used to prove and dispute the originality of Sourceduty GPTs. Sourceduty continues to competively exert a strong effort to build and expand original copyright-protected custom GPTs. [Low intelligence](https://github.com/sourceduty/AI) GPT models have gained significant popularity, primarily due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness.

Due to the delay, some of Sourceduty's custom GPTs have been reserved for publication planned after OpenAI monetizes the ChatGPT Store. [Image Emulator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-RF3VlAjnL-image-emulator) and [House Design](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-WgXvQZZ5a-house-design) are Sourcerduty's most popular GPTs currently with 1K+ chats each. Following closely behind is [Compare Documents](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-zUfIyG8eY-compare-documents), [ASCII Text Art](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-G7eF51owY-ascii-text-art) and [Road Map](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-iO18HeHn2-road-map). Five custom GPTs have been created in preparation for SORA 
videos. 

Inquire by email to buy any of Sourceduty's custom GPTs. Ownership documentation and records for each custom GPT's instructions are sent to buyers. No post-sale bug fixes or improvements will be added to any custom GPTs sold by Sourceduty. Buying and popularizing a custom GPT could be very profitable for another person, business or brand.

> Alex: *"I'm really impressed by the versatility of GPT-4. The AI tools I've been working on are turning out to be quite useful, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. It's clear that AI is poised to have a significant impact on our daily lives, and I can't wait to see how it continues to evolve and make things even better in the future."*

> *"Developing new GPTs to sell to other ChatGPT users is challenging within the overcrowded market and comes with a risk of failure when GPTs are unable to captivate users. The attraction of custom GPTs is undeniable, as they unlock a realm of possibilities tailored to individual preferences, industries, and curiosities. The attraction of custom GPTs for users lies in their capacity to provide a competitive advantage."*
