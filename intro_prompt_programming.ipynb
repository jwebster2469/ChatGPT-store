Traditionally, programming involved writing explicit code with hardcoded inputs, such as defining a function to perform a basic addition. This approach, while straightforward, lacks flexibility and adaptability, especially in scenarios requiring user interaction or real-time data processing.\n",

            "4. **Execution**: In real-world scenarios, the buy/sell actions would interface with a trading API to place actual market orders.\n",

It utilizes Pydantic for data validation and `networkx` for dynamic graph management. The system processes multiple documents concurrently, extracting essential information such as titles, authors, abstracts, keywords, and references. By integrating OpenAI's structured output capabilities, the system ensures accurate metadata extraction, enhancing the efficiency and organization of research documentation. The implementation showcases the potential of AI in automating document analysis and management workflows.\n"
